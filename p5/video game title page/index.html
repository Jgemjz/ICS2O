		<h1>Video Game Requirements</h1>
		
		<h2>Potato Dodge</h2>
		
		<ul>
			
			<li>My game will have you controlling a potato with the mouse and there's lava balls 
			falling from this top of the screen. There's also a box in the top right hand corner 
			will three hearts that will each seperatly be lit up or black depending on if you've 
			lost a life. I'll also have a meter at the top left and it'll be counting up the longer 
			you go without losing</li><br>
			
			<li>My title screen will have a forest green background 
			with a discription of what the objective for the player is 
			("Mr. Potato has a fear of being cooked alive. Help him avoid his fear by keeping him away from the dripping lava!")
			The title screen with also have a pressable button that says ("Play?")</li><br>
			
			<li>The goal for the player is to avoid the falling lava for as long as you can.
			If you hit a lava ball, you lose one of three hearts. When you lose all hearts you lose.
			You also lose if the potato rots.</li><br>
			
			<li>The player will control Mr. Potato with the mouse.</li><br>
		
			<li>Lava will fall from the top of the canvas to the bottom (in random X positions). 
			Once it reaches the bottom it goes to the top again.
			Some of the lava will fall faster than others.</li><br>
			
			<li>I may make a score showing how far your potato has ran? walked? flew?</li><br>
			
			<li>The game will end if the player loses three hearts. You'll lose a heart by being hit by a lava ball. 
			If you manage to avoid the lava balls for a long time the potato will rot and you'll lose. 
			So you can't really win.</li><br>
			
			<li>To sucessfully make this game i'll have to learn about arrays from khan academy</li><br>
		
			<li>I'll need to make functions named "Potato", "Hearts", "ball"(lava) and probably a few others too.</li><br>
