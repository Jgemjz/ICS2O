		<h1>Video Game Requirements</h1>
		
		<h2>Potato Dodge</h2>
		
		<ul>
			
			<li>My game will have you controlling a potato with the mouse and there's lava balls 
			falling from this top of the screen. There's also a box in the top right corner 
			will three hearts that will each seperatly be black or red/pink depending on if you've 
			lost a life.</li><br>
			
			<li>The screen will start with a play button and then a countdown from 3, 2, 1 Then the game will start.</li><br>
			
			<li>The goal for the player is to avoid the falling lava for as long as you can.
			If you hit a lava ball, you lose one of three hearts. When you lose all hearts you lose.
			<br>You also lose if the potato rots.(Very Possible)</li><br>
			
			<li>The player controls Mr. Potato with the mouse.</li><br>
		
			<li>Lava will fall from the top of the canvas to the bottom (in random X positions). 
			Once it reaches the bottom it goes to the top again and
			Some lava will fall faster than others.</li><br>
			
			<li>I may make a scale showing how far your potato has ran? walked? flew?</li><br>
			
			<li>The game will end if the player loses three hearts. You'll lose a heart by being hit by a lava ball. 
			If you manage to avoid the lava balls.</li><br>
			
			<li>To sucessfully make this game I had to learn from khan academy about arrays, loops and forloops </li><br>
		
			<li>I needed to make functions named: potato, endScreen, hearts from 1 to 3, lots of lava functions, draw, setup and a few others too.</li><br><br>
			
			<li><b>Instructions:</b><br>
			Mr. Potato has a fear of being cooked alive. 
			Help him avoid his fear by keeping him away from the dripping lava!<br>
			When hit by a lava ball you'll lose a life indecated by one of the three
			hearts going from red/pink to black, if all hearts go black you lose, last as long as you can.
			 </li><br>
			
			<li>You control Mr. Potato using the mouse. Have Fun :)</li><br>
